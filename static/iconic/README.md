# Thank you for downloading Iconic!

_Version 1.1.0_

This download is intended to give you an idea of what Iconic is all about. In this download, you'll find two icons in all the formats that come with Iconic. Now it's time to have fun.

## How do I get started?

1. [Read our guides](http://useiconic.com/guides/) to get the full skinny on using Iconic to its fullest. We're introducing a couple new concepts with Iconic, so we _highly_ recommend you do this first.
2. [Drop by our community forums](http://useiconic.com/community/) where you can ask questions to your heart's delight. Honestly, we want to hear from you.
3. [Follow our blog](http://blog.useiconic.com/) where we will cover interesting and new ways to work with our icons.


## What's in this download?

A lot more than you'd think, actually. You get the [Arrow Thick](http://useiconic.com/icons/arrow-thick/) and [Nexus](http://useiconic.com/icons/nexus/) icons, along with all the functionality they come with in the paid version. Below is a quick breakdown of what you can expect to find in each folder of the download package.

### Arrow thick icon

Our arrow icons are one of the best examples of what makes Iconic unique. The [Arrow Thick icon](http://useiconic.com/icons/arrow-thick/) has API methods to set arrow's [8 directions](http://useiconic.com/icons/arrow-thick/#setDirection) and [14 arrow head styles](http://useiconic.com/icons/arrow-thick/#setHead). This "single" icon has 336 permutations. 

### Nexus icon

The [Nexus icon](http://useiconic.com/icons/nexus/) shows off a feature we just released in our [1.1.0 release](http//blog.useiconic.com/iconic-version-1-1-0-is-out/). You can now add screenshots within the screen by simply setting the `data-screenshot` to a URL of an image. We believe: a) it's awesome, and b) you'll love it.


### iconic.js

You also give you the script which makes all the cool things within Iconic possible. iconic.js is tiny (2.4k min/gzipped) and packs a big punch. Make sure to read [our iconic.js documentation](https://useiconic.com/tools/iconic-js) so you get hit the ground running (faster).


## Iconic would be awesomer if it just had _______.
